# Practical-Pigs
datapack geared for making pigs practical!<br><br>

I never could find a reason to keep pigs the way we keep sheep or cows. There's just nothing I really want from pigs or any reason to keep them in masses...<br>
So now we have a reason to: for fuel! At some point down the line, I'd like to fix the blast furnace quirk with charcoal. I'd also like to grant tallow a recipe for making candles... somehow... without enabling the same for charcoal, that just seems silly... <br>
anyhow, hope this helps! happy crafting!<br><br>
Important information:<br><br>
-Pigs when bred spawn in extra pigs, from 1 to 3 (that is, spawning 2 to 4 piglets)<br>
-Pigs also drop bits of charcoal which are relabled with the magic of NBT as tallow (please download the resource pack as well, I worked really hard on that...)<br>
-porkchops can be cooked in a blast furnace to give charcoal as well~ I'd like to rework this as tallow, but I don't think any kind of furnace gives items with NBT data.<br>
