# Practical-Pigs
datapack geared for making pigs practical! 

Important information:
-Pigs when bred spawn in extra pigs, from 1 to 3 (that is, spawning 2 to 4 piglets)
-Pigs also drop bits of charcoal which are relabled with the magic of NBT as tallow (please download the resource pack as well, I worked really hard on that...)
-porkchops can be cooked in a blast furnace to give charcoal as well~ I'd like to rework this as tallow, but I don't think any kind of furnace gives items with NBT data.
